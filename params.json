This is a many-many chat application, where a chat is made between all the clients connected to a server on port 5000. This application needs to have minimum two entities i.e. the Client and the Server.\r\n\r\nThe executables of both, the client and the server are available. A server can have many clients and the messages as passed to all the clients connected with the server.\r\n\r\nThe source code of client as well as server are available under 'Source Code' directory. \r\n\r\nNOTE: The client, as well as the server function at port 5000. If any application is active at port 5000 before the chat application's execution, the application might not work and vice-versa.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
