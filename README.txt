Simple-Java-Chat-Application
============================

This is a simple chat application created out of my hobby of programming. This is a many-many chat application, where a chat is made
between all the clients. This application needs to have minimum two entities i.e. the Client and the Server.

The executables of both, the client and the server are available. A server can have many clients and the messages as passed to all
the clients connected with the server.

The source code of client as well as server are available under 'Source Code' directory. 

NOTE: The client, as well as the server function at port 5000. If any application is active at port 5000 before the chat application's
execution, the application might not work and vice-versa. In such cases, one needs to close the latter.
